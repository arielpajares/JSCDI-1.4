# JSCDI-1.4
JSCDI (JavaScriptCanvasDesignImporter) it's the name of my personal web graphics project using Rust as backend. I started it back in January of 2024 as a small project for personal use and entertainment. But as it is now, it's an ambitious project with the main purpose of being an easy implementation of web graphics in JavaScript. It will be very useful for game development at first, but I plan that it could also be adapted for other kinds of web applications.
# JSCGL-1.0
JSCGL (JavaScriptCanvasGraphicsLibrary) is an implementation of WebGL in JavaScript that I started when learning WebGL in the course of April 2025.
# JSCGL-2.0 (Coming Soon)
This is an updated version of JSCGL that implements the successor of WebGL, WebGPU. It will be available soon.
